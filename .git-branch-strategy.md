# 🗂️ Git Branch Strategy for Drawwify

This document outlines the branching strategy used in the **Drawwify** project to ensure consistency, scalability, and collaboration.

---

## 📌 Primary Branches

### `main`
- **Production-ready** branch.
- Contains only thoroughly tested, released code.
- Every version deployed to `https://drawwify.in` comes from `main`.
- Protected: All changes must go through Pull Requests.

### `dev`
- **Development integration** branch.
- Active development, bug fixes, and feature branches are merged here.
- Used for staging or pre-production testing.

## 🧩 Supporting Branches

### `feature/*`
- Used for new features.
- Naming: `feature/<feature-name>`
- Example: `feature/canvas-toolbar`
- Branches off from: `dev`
- Merges back into: `dev`

### `release/*`
- Prepares for a new version release.
- Naming: `release/v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
- Example: `release/v1.1.0`
- Branches off from: `dev`
- Merges into: `main` and `dev` (to sync changes like version bump)
- Used for final testing, documentation updates, minor fixes

### `hotfix/*`
- Critical fixes for `main` (production).
- Naming: `hotfix/<issue-name>`
- Example: `hotfix/fix-auth-error`
- Branches off from: `main`
- Merges into: `main` and `dev`

## 🚀 Release Process

1. Merge features into `dev`.
2. When stable, create a `release/*` branch.
3. Finalize the release (bump version, fix bugs).
4. Merge `release/*` into:
   - `main` → production
   - `dev` → sync new changes
5. Tag the release:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Release v1.1.0"
   git push origin v1.1.0
